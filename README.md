# Organization

We strongly advise people to chat in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/sTMX7Vh) group. However we know there's people out there who won't or cannot use Discord. We have created this repository for the sole purpose of enabling GitHub Discussions across all our projects for those unable to chat on Discord.

Click the Discussions tab at the top or click [this link](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/organization/discussions).

## Support

We have a few outlets for getting support with our projects:

- Visit our [Docs](https://docs.k8s-at-home.com/).
- Questions or comments should be discussed in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/sTMX7Vh) or via [Github discussions](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/organization/discussions).
