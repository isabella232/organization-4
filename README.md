# Organization

We strongly advise people to chat in our Discord group. However we know there's people out there who won't or cannot use Discord. We have created this repoistory for the sole purpose of enabling GitHub Discussions across all our projects for those unable to chat on Discord.

Click the Discussions tab at the top or click [this link](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/organization/discussions).
